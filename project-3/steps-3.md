# <b>Steps taken for the project's implementation</b>- Continuation.

## <b>10. Frontend Creation:</b>
   Having set up the backend and API, it is time to create a user interface for a Web client (browser) to interact with the application via API. To start out with the frontend of the `todo` app, we will use the create-react-app command as follows:

   In the `todo` directory, run this command:
   ```
   npx create-react-app client
   ```

   At the prompt, enter `y` to continue the installation. The command will eventually create a directory called `client` in the todo app where all the react codes will be.
