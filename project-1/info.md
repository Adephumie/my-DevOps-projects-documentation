# <b>Project 1- WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LAMP STACK)</b>

This project was carried out to explore and understand the different technology stacks involved in building a fully functional web application. These stacks are collectively called Web Stacks or Technology Stacks. It is defined as a set of frameworks and tools required to create and develop a well-functioning software product.

These Web Stacks are better represented with acronymns and some of them are:

<b>LAMP</b> - Linux (OS), Apache (Web Server), MySQL (DB), PHP, Python, or Perl (Language for the web server).
<br> 

<b>LEMP</b> - Linux (OS), Nginx (Web Server), MySQL (DB), PHP, Python, or Perl (Language for the web server).
<br>

<b>MERN</b> - MongoDB (DB), ExpressJs (Web  server language/Backend), ReactJs (Frontend), NodeJs (Runtime).
<br>

<b>MEAN</b> - MongoDB (DB), ExpressJs (Web  server language/Backend), AngularJs (Frontend), NodeJs (Runtime).
<br>


For this project (LAMP setup), I'll be using an Ubuntu20.04 instance on AWS and will be installing Apache, MySQL, and PHP servers on it.
