# Shell Script for creating Linux users.#
###################################################################
# This script will read a CSV file that contains 20 linux users.  #
# This script will then create each user on the server and add to #    
#  an existing group called 'Developers'.                         #
# The script will first check for the existence of the            #
# user on the system, before it will attempt to create it.        #
# The user that is being created must have a default home folder. #
# Each user should have a .ssh folder within its HOME folder. If  #
# it does not exist, then it will be created.                     #
# For each userâ€™s SSH configuration, the script will create an    #
# authorized_keys file and add the public key of the current user.#
