# <b>SHELL SCRIPTING</b>

In this project, You will learn how to automate some work using Shell Scripts. You will be onboarding 20 new Linux users onto a server. 


## <b>Introduction</b>

Linux machine, a multiuser server, requires user provisioning as part of the functions of a system administrator. Users are added, deleted, grouped, and assigned various functions and tasks. So,it usually becomes tedious to perform this repetitive tasks successfully and without mistakes.  

To  do  this, the `useradd` command comes in handy. This command comes with a lot of `options` that can be used with it to automate the creation of users. 

The `adduser` command on the other hand, is also used for creating users, however, due to its interactive mode, it isn't the best option for automation.

The  process of managing users and groups on Linux servers is termed `Identity and Access Management`.
